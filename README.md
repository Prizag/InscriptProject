# 📊 React Spreadsheet UI Replica

This project is a **pixel-perfect, responsive frontend replica** of a spreadsheet-style web application, crafted as part of a React + TypeScript assignment.  

It mimics a modern spreadsheet interface with interactive tables, sticky headers, tabbed navigation, and modular components.
